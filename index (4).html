    <p>You might think you're not in the demographic needing nutritional help- and that might be true! But here is a poke at my experience.</p>

    <p>I'm the person taking the selfie! I eat 3 meals a day, I'm the swim varsity co-captain, I cook my own healthy meals- and I love eating healthy because I know it keeps me fueld during the day, but...

    <p>...guess who was hospitalized and treated for 2 days in the ER due to digestive tract issues resulting from my diet. Prior to going to the ER, I wasn't able to go to school for a few days thinking it was a stomach bug.
      <p> I was hospitalized the DAY before my SAT (luckliy I still was able to take the test) but I could have still been hospitalized the day of my SAT depending on my severity. Additionally, I missed half of my AP Psychology final AND half of my AP Physics 1 final. Additionally, I cut down on spicy foods for a whole week before my stomachaches started, and I even made meal plans to eat healthy
         <p>...the reason why I got sick was because of introducing too many different foods into my diet too suddenly. The completely clean diet I was eating actually upset my digestive system because my digestive system was not accustomed to processing the amount of fiber and proteins I started eating. You never really know what your stomach is going to do. </p>
    <p>Bad stuff that happened as a result:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A lot of pain for like 5 days</li>
        <li>Stress from missing my exams</li>
        <li>Needing to stay in the hospital (NOT a fun experience)</li>
        <li>Not eating for 48 hours "just in case I needed to go into surgery"</li>

    </div>
  <p>Take good care of your health! Start with slow changes in your diet by adding foods that nourish you.
